<p>
Across the world, Open Data platforms are publishing an ever-growing number of high-quality datasets that cover all aspects of daily life – from weather and the environment to transportation, health, and more. But with this abundance comes a new challenge: it's becoming harder to find meaningful insights hidden within the data.
</p>

<p>
Open-Data Insights helps make sense of this complexity by using artificial intelligence to generate short, readable stories based on open datasets. Each insigth publication is triggered by predefined rules that identify events worth reporting – for example, when temperatures reach extreme highs or lows, or when environmental standards are exceeded. When such an event is detected, AI generates a story that explains what happened and why it matters.
</p>

<p>
This app automatically creates new stories every day. One of them is randomly selected and shown on the home page. You can use the explorer menu to browse all generated insights and access the underlying data.
</p>

<p>
To receive tailored stories that match your interests, simply register and subscribe to specific datasets or themes via your <a href="{% url 'account:profile' %}">profile page</a>. Whenever a relevant event is detected, you'll receive a freshly generated story — directly in your inbox.
</p>

<p>
All stories are based on data from publicly available, official Open Data platforms. The goal is to help everyone – from engaged citizens to decision-makers – better understand the world through data.

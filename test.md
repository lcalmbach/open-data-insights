### Comparison to Previous Years

- **Comparison to Last Year (2023):** The data for 2023 is identical to the data for 2024, indicating no change in the number of dogs or the ranking of the top five breeds.
  
- **Comparison to 2019 (Pre-COVID):** Unfortunately, the data for 2019 is not provided in the current dataset. However, if there was a significant increase in the number of dogs from 2019 to 2024, it could suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic led more people to acquire dogs, as was observed in many regions globally.

### Conclusion

The data for 2024 shows a stable situation with no changes from the previous year. Without the 2019 data, we cannot definitively conclude the impact of the pandemic on dog ownership in this dataset. However, the consistent numbers suggest a steady interest in dog ownership, with Chihuahuas remaining the most popular breed.
